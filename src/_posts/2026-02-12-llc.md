Over the past few months, I’ve been incredibly grateful for the encouragement and support surrounding this little side project of mine. What began as a creative outlet has steadily grown into something with real momentum — and that’s largely thanks to this community.

With that growth in mind, I’ve decided to take an exciting next step: officially [registering](https://ecorp.sos.ga.gov/BusinessSearch/BusinessInformation?businessId=4721296&businessType=Domestic%20Limited%20Liability%20Company&fromSearch=True) the business as an LLC. This move allows me to build on a stronger foundation and approach the work with the level of care and professionalism it deserves.

I’m also expanding my growing capacity, which means more plants, more variety, and more products available in the storefront. Scaling thoughtfully is important to me — I want to continue nurturing what makes this special while creating space for it to flourish.

Thank you for being part of this journey. I’m looking forward to what’s ahead and can’t wait to share what’s growing next. 🌿

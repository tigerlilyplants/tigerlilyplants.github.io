My shop is proudly queer and woman-owned, and I’m committed to creating a welcoming space for all plant lovers. I have a deep passion for plants and love helping people experience their beauty up close. I specialize in exotic and uncommon varieties that stand out for their unique colors, shapes, and textures. Whether you’re new to plant care or already collecting, I’m happy to help you find the right plant for your space!

I'm also a proud cat mama of two boys, Luigi and Aladdin!
